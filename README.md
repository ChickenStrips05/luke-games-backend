## What is this?

This is going to be a simple statistics and administration tool for very small websites. Just deploy it using a service like [glitch.com](https://glitch.com)(not recomended because of some issues) or [render.com](https://render.com). Or you can just run it on your own domain using a web server like [nginx](https://nginx.org).

## How does this work?

Once this is deployed, it will have a constant connection with all clients using websockets and be able to monitor and control them to some extent. For example, the client will connect to this server using a script on the website. Then it will send over some information, like its url, last sites, IP, ect. Then you, as an administrator, will be able to maybe send a message to the user, kick them from the website, or temporarily pause them while updates are being made.

## Is this a serious project?

No, this isn't made for any actual big projects, this was intended for small projects such as simple glitch websites for your classmates, hence the "luke-games" at [luke-games.glitch.me](https://luke-games.glitch.me). You may use this however you'd like.
